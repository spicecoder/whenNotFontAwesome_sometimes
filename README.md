Android fontawesome app to convert unicode to the icon interactively.
It remains a mystrey to me why on the android platform some of the font awesome codes e.g f571 fonts simply does  not 
render the icon ; where as others e.g f06e (eye)  works fine.
I made this little app just to check upfront whether the font is working.
If you have any idea why this is happening please respond.

The app takes the unicode e.g \uf06e in the edit box and renders the font [some times ;)]
